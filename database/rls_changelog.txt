4FIT DATABASE RLS IMPLEMENTATION CHANGELOG
=====================================================

Implementation Date: 2025-01-09
Senior Database Architect: Claude Code
Goal: Implement comprehensive Row Level Security for multi-tenant fitness management system

BUSINESS SECURITY MODEL:
========================
- Multi-tenant architecture (Box-based isolation)
- Role hierarchy: super_admin > admin > coach > receptionist  
- User data ownership with public/private controls
- Membership-based access patterns
- Cross-box security isolation

MULTI-TENANCY RULES:
- MULTI-BOX MEMBERSHIP: Users can be members of multiple boxes simultaneously
- MULTI-BOX COACHES: Coaches can work across multiple boxes with separate Box_Staff records
- SINGLE-BOX ADMINS: Admins are restricted to one box per account (business requirement)

DATA ISOLATION RULES:
- WORKOUT RESULTS: Strictly isolated per box (only visible within box where created)
- PAYMENT DATA: Strictly isolated per box (security requirement)
- PR RECORDS: If public=true, visible across all boxes where user is member
- PUBLIC RESULTS: When true, data visible to all members/staff within same box only
- SUPER ADMIN ACCESS: Complete cross-box access to all data
- COACH BOX-SWITCHING: Same account, different contextual views per box
